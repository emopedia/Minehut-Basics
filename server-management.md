### Accessing the Server Console

- You can access the server console by clicking the `Console` button on the server dashboard. The console is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your server in real-time.
- You can use the console to input commands and view server output. You can also use it to troubleshoot issues and monitor server activity.
- The console also allows you to enter server commands, such as `op playername`, which gives that player full administrative permissions on your server. It also allows you to view the logs of your server and the players in it.
##### Never give OP to people you do not trust 100%. OPing someone who is not fully trusted could lead to total destruction of your server. Use at your own risk.
