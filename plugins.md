## Plugins

This guide will help you understand how to install and use plugins on your Minehut server.

### Installing Plugins
- You can install plugins directly from the Minehut panel.
- Go to the server dashboard and click on the `Add-ons` tab.
- Search for the plugin you want to install and click on `Install`.
- The plugin will be installed and automatically enabled on your server.
- Note that some plugins may not be compatible or take you to an external website to install them, in this case you may need to install them manually.

### Installing Plugins Manually
- You can also download plugins from external sources such as Bukkit or Spigot.
- Make sure to download the version of the plugin that is compatible with your server version.
- Once downloaded, you can add the plugin to your server by adding it to the `/plugins` folder of your server via the panel file manager.

### Managing Plugins
- You can manually enable or disable a plugin by renaming the plugin file in the `/plugins` folder of your server via the panel file manager.
- To disable a plugin, simply add `.disabled` at the end of the plugin file name.
- To enable a plugin, remove `.disabled` from the plugin file name.
- Note that you will need to restart the server for changes to take effect.
###### Downloading paid plugins for free from external sources is risky and not recommended. If you are to pirate plugins, download at your own risk. Minehut is not responsible for any damages that happen to your server from external plugins.
